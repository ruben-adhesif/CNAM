# CNAM
Our project is focused on the use of prosopographical databases in history. These databases are collections of documents that gather detailed information about individuals, including names, birth and death dates, activities, social relations, and involvement in historical events. Such data is crucial for the work of historians. However, the information can sometimes be uncertain, incomplete, or biased, highlighting the need for validation or refutation through cross-referencing different sources. 

## Objectif

The objective of this project is to:  
- Transcript image of handwriting documents in text format 
- Extract named entities such as people, places, and dates.  
- Identify the relationships between these entities.  
- Compare these findings with existing databases at CNAM and Paris 1 University. 

A unique challenge of this project is dealing with texts in various languages, including Medieval French and Latin. Furthermore, not all texts are digitized, necessitating a tool capable of recognizing handwritten text etc.
